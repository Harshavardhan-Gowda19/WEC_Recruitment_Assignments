# DeepFake Image Classification

This project addresses DeepFake detection by combining traditional image processing techniques with machine learning. The model uses a combination of feature extraction methods, such as Canny edge detection and Local Binary Pattern (LBP), with an SVM classifier for accurate classification of images as real or fake.

### 1. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
This project leverages edge and texture analysis to enhance DeepFake detection. The modelâ€™s architecture, built without deep learning layers, captures subtle features through traditional ML techniques, aiming for better accuracy in discerning authentic and manipulated images.

### 2. Techniques and Methodologies <a name="techniques-and-methodologies"></a>
- **Canny Edge Detection**: Highlights prominent edges to reveal boundary inconsistencies that suggest manipulation.
- **Local Binary Pattern (LBP)**: Encodes texture patterns, identifying differences between natural and synthetic textures.
- **DFT Visualization**: Computes and visualizes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an image to analyze frequency components for potential anomalies.
  
### 3. Model Pipeline <a name="model-pipeline"></a>
- **Feature Extraction**: Canny edge detection and LBP extract crucial image characteristics.
- **DFT Computation**: Visualizes the frequency spectrum of images to detect subtle inconsistencies.
- **Classification**: An SVM classifier integrates extracted features to classify images as real or fake.

### 4. Future Improvements <a name="future-improvements"></a>
- **Refinement of Edge Detection**: Testing advanced edge techniques for subtle manipulation detection.
- **Feature Set Expansion**: Exploring additional texture or frequency features to enhance model performance.
