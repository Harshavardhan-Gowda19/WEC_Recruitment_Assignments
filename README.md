## ml-assignment-1.ipynb

This model involves predicting the likelihood of loan defaults for a non-banking financial institution (NBFI) facing challenges due to increased defaults in its vehicle loan category. By analyzing various parameters that influence a borrower's repayment ability, the model aims to enhance the company's understanding of its clients and improve decision-making processes. Ultimately, the goal is to optimize financial performance through accurate assessments of loan repayment risks.

## Task 1 - Kaggle Competition

This task involved building computer vision provided datasets for a Kaggle competition. And the task is completed successfully.

### Subtask 1.1 - Computer Vision

I developed a CNN model for **DeepFake detection** and initially assigned the wrong labels to the images. However, I was able to correct them with a straightforward logic after making predictions, which underscored the significance of proper initialization in the project.

## Task 2 - Underwater Image Enhancement Project

This task involved developing models for image enhancement, with a comparison of different approaches based on evaluation metrics.

### Subtask 2.1 - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

I trained a **Variational Autoencoder** (VAE) model to enhance underwater images, improving their clarity and quality.

### Subtask 2.2 - GAN on MNIST

I implemented a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** model on the MNIST dataset, successfully generating new digit samples as part of this experiment.

### Subtask 2.3 - GAN on Given Dataset

For this subtask, I implemented a **GAN model on the provided dataset**.

### Subtask 2.4 - Diffusion Model

I implemented a **Diffusion Model** for image enhancement. The base architecture was provided, and I built on that to enhance underwater images.

## Conclusion

Welcome to the Hogwarts Q&A project. This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is designed to provide informative answers to inquiries about "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban." Utilizing advanced text embeddings and a streamlined query interface, the application retrieves contextually relevant responses directly from the book. Users can explore details about characters, spells, and magical events, enhancing their understanding of the wizarding world. Engage with this tool to experience the rich lore of Hogwarts in an interactive format.

Iam very glad that I got this second opportunity!
